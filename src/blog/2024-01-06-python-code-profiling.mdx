This blog is a result of a [spike](https://github.com/tattle-made/feluda/issues/42) exploring python code profiling. I will list down all the tools/libraries/methods tested around profiling python code. 

### What is Code Profiling?
Code profiling is a method that is used to detect how long each function or line of code takes 
to run and how often it gets executed. Along with time, we can also profile memory and see how much RAM a line of code/ function takes to run. 

### Code that we will use for profiling
As we test out different tools/libraries/methods, I will use Tesseract OCR code for testing purposes. [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) is an OCR enginer that can help detect text from an inmage in more than 100 langauges. Below is a code snippet on how to use Tesseract.
```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

image_path = 'text.png'
data = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_path, lang='eng+hin', config='--psm 6 --oem 1')
print(data)
```

We want to profile this code and also do laod testing for it.
